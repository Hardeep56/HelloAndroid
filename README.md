Hello, Android! â€“ A Simple Android App"
Purpose of the Program
This Android application is designed to display a simple "Hello, Android!" message on the screen. It serves as a foundational project for understanding the basic structure of an Android app using Kotlin.

Obstacles Faced
During development, one of the primary challenges was setting up the Android development environment correctly, ensuring that Android Studio, SDK, and emulators were properly installed. Additionally, understanding the layout design in XML and how Kotlin interacts with it required some exploration.

Skills Acquired
Through this project, I learned:

How to set up an Android project in Android Studio.
The basic structure of an Android app (activities, layouts).
How to use Kotlin for Android development.
How to use an emulator to test the application.
